# Javascript Made Simple!


Not ever frontend projects needs to use a set of complex tools to build or run.
Almost all of the new Javascript projects contains a Framework with this tools, 
transpilers, transformers, minifiers, css libs and dependencies for every feature.

But you dont necessarily need to follow this way to build your application, specially
if your project is a small. This P.O.C. is about one simple crud created with modern
Javascript with no dependencies. The ```package.json``` contains only two optional 
tools: http-server for manual tests and Playwright for integration tests.

It was written using the functional paradigm because Javascript is more Haskell than Java!

About the css, no one lib or framework was used, just a css reset followed by the app style.
